# DESCRIPTION
This repository contains a network topology demonstrating the configuration of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) with a backbone area (Area 0) and two additional areas. The topology includes five routers, three switches, and four PCs. This setup provides a practical example of segmenting a network into multiple OSPF areas for efficient routing and improved scalability.

# TOPOLOGY OVERVIEW
- ROUTERS: Five routers configured with OSPF are distributed across Area 0 (Backbone Area), Area 1, and Area 2.
- SWITCHES: Three switches providing network connectivity.
- PCs: Four PCs connected to various network segments for testing and demonstration purposes.

CONTENTS
- Topology Diagram: A visual representation of the network layout.
- Configuration Files: Configuration files for each router in the topology.
